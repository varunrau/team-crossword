### How it works

The goal of the game — like standard crosswords — is to guess words based on crossword clues. However, in this game, you’re competing against other players for control over the same board!

**Set up**

1. Upload a `.puz` file. You can find them on sites like https://crosswordfiend.com/download/ or you can make your own on sites like [https://exet.app](https://exet.app/).
2. Create two or more teams. A team consists of a name and a color.

**Gameplay**

1. Click on a clue to reveal the clue.
2. Type in an answer and click check puzzle. All correct characters will be highlighted in green and all incorrect characters will be highlighted in red.
3. If the guess was correct, then that team may choose another clue and go back to step 1.
4. If the guess was incorrect, then it is the next team’s turn.

**Scoring and endgame**

Teams score points based on the number of letters they correctly guess (not the number of words). The game is complete once all clues have been correctly guessed.
